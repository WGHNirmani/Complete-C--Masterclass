Naming Conventions in C#

  Camel Case
    Camel case is a naming convention where the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. This is often used for variable and method names.
    Example:
    int myVariable;

  Pascal Case
    Pascal case is a naming convention where the first letter of each word is capitalized. This is commonly used for class and namespace names.
    Example:
    public class MyClass {
    }

  Snake Case
    Snake case is a naming convention where words are seperated by underscores. This convention is not used in C# but is used in other programming languages like Python.
      Example:
      int my_variable;

Naming Conventions for Classes, Methods, and Variables

  1. Classes
      Class names should be in Pascal case, starting with an uppercase letter. They should be descriptive and represent the purpose of the class.

  2. Methods
      Method names should also be in Pascal case, starting with an uppercase letter. They should be verb based and describe the action the method performs.

  3. Variables
      variable namesshould be in camel case, starting with a lowercase letter. They should be concise and meaningful, conveying the purpose of the variable.

Best Practices for Consistent and Readable C# Code
  Clarity

  Consistency
    Adhere to a consistent naming convention throught the codebase.

  Collaboration
    Follow established team or company coding standards to facilitate colloboration.

  Maintainability
    Prioratize readability and understandability to make the code easier to maintain.
