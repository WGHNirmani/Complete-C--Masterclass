Value tyoe and reference type

  Data types can be categorized into two categories based on how they occupy memory location.

  Those categories are value type and reference type.

Value type in detail

  * Store actual data directly

  * Typically stored in the stack

  * Include int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal, struct, enum

  * Nullable versions available (int?, double?, etc.)

  * Can be stored in heap if part of a reference type

Reference type in detail

  * Reference type is a variable tyoe which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location of the actual data.

  * The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly.

  * Reference type data types are string, class, Array etc.

  * When we copy this reference type of a data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variables pointing to the same data.
